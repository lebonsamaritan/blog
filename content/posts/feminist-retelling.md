From Penelopiad to *Lady Macbeth*: *A Novel*, 
feminist retellings of ancient tales have become a staple in bookstores, 
often prominently displayed at the front of the store along with other New York Times bestsellers. 
In fact, they have become so popular and prevalent that 
they have become a subgenre in modern fiction. 

To preface this, 
I am by no means against or disapprove of feminist retellings. 
In fact, I believe that the reclamation of female characters is beneficial, or perhaps even necessary, 
to the development of a distinct female voice in literature. 
As noted by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in their revolutionary literary critique of Victorian literature, 
*The Madwoman in the Attic*, male authors have molded two archetypes for their female characters to fit neatly into: 
the angel and the monster. 
The angel is the pure, idealized woman, 
with no story of her own and serving only to make others great while never being great herself. 
On the other hand is the antithetical mirror image of the angel. 
The monster is the assertive, provocative woman who is rendered hideous by her attempts to become autonomous. 
The monster is flesh where the angel is spirit, sensual where the angel is virginal, evil where the angel is good. 
On these harmful stereotypes that stifle female creativity, 
Virginia Woolf wrote, “I turned upon her and caught her by the throat. 
I did my best to kill her… Had I not killed her she would have killed me.” 
Thus, breathing fresh life into the previously vacuous female characters is a noble and worthwhile endeavor. 
Except when it goes wrong. 

Ava Reid’s *Lady Macbeth* promised a feminist reimagining of Shakespeare’s most iconic villain, 
and to  give “her a voice, a past, and a power that transforms the story men have written for her.” 
In this novel, Lady Macbeth is no longer the middle-aged matron of Glamis, 
but a young bastard daughter of a French nobleman named Roscille. 
The story does not hesitate to lean into the fantastical elements of Macbeth, 
as Roscille’s main love interest can shapeshift into a dragon. 
It also does not hesitate to completely deviate from the original plotline of the play 
by making Lady Macbeth fake her suicide and running away with the man of her dreams. 
But none of this is necessarily a flaw, right? 
After all, reimaginings are permitted to take their creative liberties and go off script. 
The character assassination in this book, however, is an artistic sin.

The choice of Lady Macbeth to be the protagonist of a feminist retelling is quite bizarre in itself, 
as she was one of, if not the most, powerful and ambitious female characters of her time. 
She was not defined by her husband; rather, her husband was defined by her.  
Bold and audacious, she looks her warrior husband in the eye and, 
when he fears to reach out and grasp the destiny laid before him, 
she tells him to ‘screw his courage to the sticking place’ and commit the murder 
that they both know is necessary to secure the throne. 
She is Macbeth’s wife, partner in crime, strategist, and even occasional tormentor, his equal on all counts. 
However, she was more dynamic than her contemporary female “monsters.” 
Her pangs of guilt and later madness point to a more nuanced and moral character behind her vicious facade. 
Thus, I found it even more bizarre 
that Reid somehow managed to take a female character with such autonomy and depth and turn her into a pale shell of her former self. 

Reid’s characterization of women in her novel seems to be some horrible misunderstanding of feminist literature. 
In an attempt to rid her protagonist of any qualities that can desecrate her unadulterated goodness, 
Reid’s Lady Macbeth becomes the modern angel of the house, 
without any personal desires of her own and innocent as a girl. 
Instead of Lady Macbeth persuading her husband to usurp the throne, 
her violent, brutish husband is the one urging her instead. 
Lady Macbeth afraid of her husband, how is that conceivable? 
She is not even capable of the same vivid and introspective emotions as her 16th century original; 
the only feeling she feels throughout the novel aside from her disgust towards her Scottish peers is love for the only man in the entire novel who is not utter garbage. 
Other women in the narrative are only ever described as ugly and masculine to contrast with Roscille’s delicate beauty. 
Clearly, portraying all other female characters as repulsive compared to the pure, 
beautiful Roscille is the ultimate way to showcase the female condition in literature. 

Additionally, the implication that women should only be capable of good and that any violence is only done as retaliation to male aggression is insultingly dismissive of women’s potential. 
Even the male writers from centuries ago recognized women’s innate pernicious potential. 
For example, in the *City of Dickens*, Alexander Welsh asked the sinister and witty question, 
“Who, in the language of detective fiction, was the last to see Dora Copperfield alive?” 
to suggest potentially dark things about the angelic Agnes Wickfield. 
If the idea of a selfish woman driven by a desire for power and self-determination could be accepted back then, 
why is that same idea so repulsive to supposed feminist writers now?
